  <h3 class="title"><em>Overview</em></h3>
    <p>CSS can change the look of HTML elements. In order to do this, CSS must select HTML elements, then apply styles to them.</p>
  <p>CSS can select HTML elements by tag, class, or ID.</p>
  <p>Multiple CSS classes can be applied to one HTML element.</p>
  <p>Classes can be reusable, while IDs can only be used once.</p>
  <p>IDs are more specific than classes, and classes are more specific than tags. That means IDs will override any styles from a class, and classes will override any styles from a tag selector.</p>
  <p>Multiple selectors can be chained together to select an element. This raises the specificity, but can be necessary.</p>
  <p>Nested elements can be selected by separating selectors with a space.</p>
  <p>The !important flag will override any style, however it should almost never be used, as it is extremely difficult to override.</p>
  <p>Multiple unrelated selectors can receive the same styles by separating the selector names with commas.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Linking-CSS-HTML">
  <h3 class="title"><em>Linking CSS and HTML Files</em></h3>
  <p>You can use the &lt;link&gt; element to link HTML and CSS files together. The &lt;link&gt; element must be placed within the head of the HTML file. It is a self-closing tag and requires the following three attributes:</p>
  <table border="1" class="table1">
    <thead class="tablehead1">
      <td></td>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>Example</td>
    </thead>
      <tr> <!--First Row-->
        <td><strong>href</strong></td>
      <td>Like the anchor element, the value of this attribute must be the address, or path, to the CSS file.</td>
        <td>href="./styles.css"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> <!--Second Row-->
      <td><strong>type</strong></td>
      <td>This attribute describes the type of document that you are linking to (in this case, a CSS file). The value of this attribute should be set to text/css.</td>
      <td>type="text/css"</td>
    </tr>
    <tr> <!--Third Row-->
      <td><strong>rel</strong></td>
      <td>This attribute describes the relationship between the HTML file and the CSS file. Because you are linking to a stylesheet, the value should be set to stylesheet.</td>
      <td>rel="stylesheet"</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>When linking an HTML file and a CSS file together, the &lt;link&gt; element will look like the following:</p>
  <p class="example">&lt;link href="https://www.codecademy.com/stylesheets/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Chaining-Selectors">
  <h3 class="title"><em>Chaining Selectors</em></h3>
  <p>When writing CSS rules, itâ€™s possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.</p>
  <p>This is done by combining multiple selectors, which we will refer to as chaining. For instance, if there was a .special class for h1 elements, the CSS would look like:</p>
  <p class="example">h1.special {<br>
  }</p>
  <p>The code above would select only the h1 elements that have a class of special. If a p element also had a class of special, the rule in the example would not style the paragraph.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="Nested-Elements">
  <h3 class="title"><em>Nested Elements</em></h3>
  <p>In addition to chaining selectors to select elements, CSS also supports selecting elements that are nested within other HTML elements. For instance, consider the following HTML:</p>
  <p class="example">&lt;ul class='main-list'&gt;<br>
  &emsp;&lt;li&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &emsp;&lt;li&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt;<br>
  &emsp;&lt;li&gt; ... &lt;/li&gt;<br>
    &lt;/ul&gt;</p>
  <p>The nested &lt;li&gt; elements are selected with the following CSS:</p>
  <p class="example">.main-list li {<br>
<br>
    }</p>
  <p>In the example above, .main-list selects the .main-list element (the unordered list element). The nested &lt;li&gt; are selected by adding li to the selector, separated by a space, resulting in .main-list li as the final selector (note the space in the selector).

Selecting elements in this way can make our selectors even more specific by making sure they appear in the context we expect.</p>
